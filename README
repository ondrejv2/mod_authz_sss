Apache module mod_authz_sss
=================================

Apache module to authorize previously authenticated user based on
groups he is member of. It is ideal to be used in conjunction with
the mod_auth_gssapi module which provides the authentication.

The module supports retrieval of list of group names the user belongs 
to via SSSD D-Bus call using org.freedesktop.sssd.infopipe.GetUserGroups
method.

The sssd-dbus package needs to be installed and the ifp service
enabled in the [sssd] section of /etc/sssd/sssd.conf.

The module itself needs to be loaded into Apache's configuration file
like /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf with directive like

    LoadModule authz_sss_module modules/mod_authz_sss.so

Mod_Authz_sss would come into play if you wanted to further restrict access
to specific groups SSSD recognizes - these can be Posix (i.e. unix) 
or even non-Posix. You might append the following directive:

    Require sss-group staff admin

This would allow only access to accounts in the 'staff' or 'admin' groups.

Example of sssd.conf:

    [domain/example.com]
    ...

    [sssd]
    services = nss, pam, ssh, ifp

    [ifp]
    allowed_uids = apache, root


Building from sources
---------------------

The available version of sssd has to provide the ifp dbus service
When building from sources, command

    apxs -i -a -c $(pkg-config --cflags dbus-1) $(pkg-config --libs dbus-1) \
	 -Wc,"-Wall -pedantic -std=c99" mod_authz_sss.c

should build and install the module.

Limitations
--------------------

The authenticated user has to be a POSIX user. You can possibly also use
non-POSIX users enabling Application typed SSSD domains - see:

https://pagure.io/SSSD/sssd/issue/3310

but the state of support of this is unknown (does not seem to work):

https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues/8218

You need to authenticate using principal that SSSD is able to resolve.
this is usually in form of "User Principal Name" - especially when the
SSSD backend is configured to use Active Directory, see bug:

https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-3697

which is fixed in newer versions of SSSD.
